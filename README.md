# **World Weather Analysis**
## Project overview
This is challenge is meant to retrieve weather data using APIs. We will load and save using JSON world weather data that will be later used to plan vacation and map an itinerary for vacation.
## Analysis
Having retrieved the weather data we would ask a use to specify data temperature range and narrow vacation destinations based on these criteria. We Would then offer the user information that includes hotels in the chosen area.
We used random coordinates to generate the listing of destinations. We then selected to cities in Russia. The following cities were retained:
1) Divnoye	RU	276.56	45.9089	43.3547	Motel Manych-Gudilo
2) Derbent	RU	281.55	42.0678	48.2899	Elit
3) Onguday	RU	273.31	50.7500	86.1500	Gostinitsa "Motel'"
4) Kuytun	RU	263.80	54.3419	101.5036	Gostinitsa Tsentral'naya.
With that information we created an itinerary that spaces across Russia. We also offered tags, to the best of our abilities, to assist them.

Attachment 2 - [itinerary with markers](https://github.com/RichardYDepestre/World_Weather_Analysis_final/blob/main/WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png?raw=true).
Given more time we could have run a model in which we played with fares and showcases the revenues they could have generated. Such a task would have lent more credential to our recommendations. With experience and practice we will get there!
## Recommendations to CEO
We take the liberty and formulate the following recommendation the PyBer's CEO:
   1) start tracking the distances -mileage- covered by drivers and determine a rate that would increase the customer base;
   2) if polling suggest that the rural and suburban areas may expand it would make sense to establish a reward system that would offer incentives to customers, otherwise use option 3;
   3) increase the number of drivers in the city and make Pyber readily available to customers
The attached plot show that the suburban rides show a significant spike in May and may offer as much potential as the urban market Attachment 2 [Total fare by City Type](https://github.com/RichardYDepestre/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png).
