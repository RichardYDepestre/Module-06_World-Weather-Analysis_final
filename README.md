# **World Weather Analysis**
## Project overview
This is challenge is meant to retrieve weather data using APIs. We will load and save using JSON world weather data that will be later used to plan vacation and map an itinerary for vacation.
## Analysis
Having retrieved the weather data we would ask a use to specify data temperature range and narrow vacation destinations based on these criteria. We Would then offer the user information that includes hotels in the chosen area.
We used random coordinates to generate the listing of destinations. We then selected to cities in Russia. The following cities were retained:
1) Divnoye	RU	276.56	45.9089	43.3547	Motel Manych-Gudilo
2) Derbent	RU	281.55	42.0678	48.2899	Elit
3) Onguday	RU	273.31	50.7500	86.1500	Gostinitsa "Motel'"
4) Kuytun	RU	263.80	54.3419	101.5036	Gostinitsa Tsentral'naya.
With that information we created an itinerary that spaces across Russia. We also offered tags, to the best of our abilities, to assist them.
